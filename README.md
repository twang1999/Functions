# Functions

There are two pieces of code in this repository, both blank. The first exercise should be done in "VoidFunctions" and the second should be done in "ReturningValues"

# Part 1: VoidFunctions Exercises

* Draw a blue square at the center of the canvas, with a size of 50x50

* Define one other function of your choice
Remember to commit and sync.
